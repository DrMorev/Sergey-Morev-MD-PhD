### My AI Research Workflow: Cross-Platform Agentic Architecture
I employ a human-led, cross-platform agentic research workflow designed to ensure rigor, safety, and reproducibility in high-stakes AI research.
Rather than relying on a single model or perspective, I use a distributed, role-based evaluation pipeline, where frontier LLMs are treated as specialized computational components, each constrained to a clearly defined function.
All synthesis, prioritization, and final decisions remain under explicit human control.
Core Workflow Layers
1. Research & Methodology Validation
Scientific framing and positioning within existing literature gaps
Methodological sanity checks for N=1, longitudinal, and case-based designs
Cross-model triangulation to reduce single-source bias and hallucinations
2. Technical Development & System Architecture
Refactoring experimental logic into production-grade, documented codebases
Design of modular external reasoning scaffolds (e.g., Modular Reasoning Framework)
Interface, API, and artifact consistency checks
3. Safety, QA & Compliance (Adversarial Review Layer)
Systematic stress-testing of safety boundaries and failure modes
Pharmacovigilance-inspired audit logic applied to LLM behavior
Strict Definition-of-Done (DoD) gates before any artifact is finalized
4. Strategic Orchestration & Oversight (Human PI Control)
Scope management and prevention of uncontrolled feature expansion
Cross-architecture output auditing to detect instability and drift
Final synthesis, judgment, and accountability retained by the researcher
Why Cross-Platform?
Specialization: Different model architectures excel at different tasks (reasoning, nuance, robustness).
Behavioral Analysis: Comparing responses across models is critical for AI Safety research.
Redundancy: Prevents hidden failure modes caused by single-model drift or bias.
This workflow is intentionally designed as a reproducible research system, not as conversational or companion-based interaction.
