# Sergey Morev, MD/PhD

**Transportation & Logistics (New Brunswick, Canada)**

Medical background (MD/PhD) with 6+ years in pharmacovigilance and drug safety.

Personal open-source interest: **reliability, evaluation, and safety in technology - especially where AI meets healthcare and other medical safety-sensitive domains, AI compliance and regulations.**

> **Disclaimer:** Personal, non-commercial open-source research only.

## Areas of interest

### Reliability & Evaluation in Safety-Sensitive Systems
- Evaluation methodologies and reproducible test suites
- Safety and robustness qualification gates
- Drift detection and behavior stability monitoring
- Audit-friendly artifacts: checklists, rubrics, decision logs

### Architecture Comparison & Reasoning Approaches
- Decision frameworks for choosing between system architectures (LLM-centric, world-model-based, hybrid closed-loop)
- Structured reasoning aids for language models
- Tradeoff analysis: cost-of-error, latency, verification constraints

### Human–AI Interaction & Digital Hygiene
- Interaction patterns, boundary-setting, and safe use frameworks
- Risk modes in companion-style AI (dependency, over-trust, erosion of autonomy)
- Occupationally isolated workers: patterns of use and patterns of harm

### Medical Technology Assessment (mindset)
- Evidence-based evaluation and structured risk mapping
- Post-claim qualification: “claims ≠ clearance”
- Reproducible protocols over demo theater

## How I work (human-led, independent cross-checking)

1. **Method sanity checks** - framing, assumptions, failure modes; independent cross-checking for consistency
1. **Engineering discipline** - prototypes refactored into documented, testable artifacts; stable interfaces and minimal reproducible examples
1. **Adversarial QA** - stress tests for unsafe behavior, hallucinated outputs, and format brittleness; “definition-of-done” gates before publishing
1. **Human oversight** - scope control, final synthesis, and accountability stay with me

This is a **reproducible evaluation workflow**, not a companion-style interaction.

## Background (high level)
- **MD/PhD** - pediatric surgery, rheumatology (training background)
- **6+ years** - pharmacovigilance, drug safety, real-world evidence
- **Current role** - transportation and logistics (Canada)
- **Ongoing personal interest** - AI evaluation, human–AI interaction, open-source research

-----

## Open to (non-commercial)
- Open-source collaboration (personal time)
- Research discussion and peer review
- Writing and speaking (unpaid) on topics above

*Commercial or paid engagements are not available at this time.*
