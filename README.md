## Sergey Morev - MD/PhD (personal, non-commercial open-source)

**Current role:** Transportation & Logistics (New Brunswick, Canada)  
**Medical background:** MD/PhD + 6+ years in pharmacovigilance & drug safety  
**Scope:** Personal, non-commercial open-source research only.

### Focus
Deterministic boundaries for probabilistic models before they touch real-world workflows.

---

## Research areas (personal OSS)

### 1) Runtime verification & deterministic safety gates
- Enforcement patterns separating probabilistic generation from workflow action
- Deterministic PASS / BLOCK / ABSTAIN gates for state-changing steps
- Translating clinical cost-of-failure into explicit engineering constraints
- Evidence model: traces + constraints + audit artifacts (natural-language claims alone aren’t evidence)

### 2) Qualification under pressure & behavior stability
- Reproducible crash-tests for role drift
- Stress evaluation beyond benchmark accuracy (auditable FAIL artifacts)
- Post-claim qualification: claims ≠ clearance

### 3) Architecture selection under hard constraints
- Decision protocols for LLM-only vs world-model vs hybrid approaches
- Hard tradeoffs: latency budgets, verification independence, cost-of-error
- Reasoning orchestration patterns (Plan → Execute → Verify) for lightweight/edge settings

---

## How I do my research  (independent & verifiable)
- Method sanity checks: framing, assumptions, failure modes; independent cross-checking
- Engineering discipline: prototypes → documented, testable artifacts; stable interfaces; minimal reproducible examples
- Adversarial QA: stress tests for unsafe behavior, hallucinated actions, and format brittleness; definition-of-done gates

## Availability (non-commercial only)
Open to: open-source collaboration (personal time), research discussion / peer review, unpaid writing & speaking.  
Commercial or paid engagements are not available at this time.
